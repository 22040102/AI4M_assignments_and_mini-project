## Mini Project, Aerial DCGAN

My mini project is a notebook file containing training of a DCGAN. I wanted to trial the DCGAN, knowing that it isn't one of the most modern GAN models, how efficiently it can still run. I have used a dataset of 566 files of aerial imagery input into the model and have adapted the parameters throughout different training runs to compare the outputs generated. Both the start and end has discussion of the project.
